# sundarlsr.github.io - This repository has been created for assigment 4.

Project: Common Algorithm Development.
    	This project is developed to support the Standard Template Library Algorithms provides general-purpose, templatized classes and functions 
that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and  data structures like (Vectors, Lists, Queues, Map, Multimap, Set, Stack, Counting Algorithm, 
Transform Algorithm, stacks and Templates).

The Common algorithm divides the Standard Template Library programs into two main items: containers and algorithms. 

Containers:  Containers are objects that hold other objects.
•	Vector 
•	List 
•	Map	

Algorithms: Algorithms act on the contents of containers. Many algorithms operate on a range of elements within a container.
•	Sorting, 
•	Searching, 
•	Transforming 

These algorithms will be improted as a library fucntion to the projects and the project will utilize the fucntions required for the implementation.

This project contains code for some common important algorithms listed below - 

1 - Binary Search - Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n). 

2 - Fibonacci Series - A program to generate a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

3 - Linked List - A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

4 - Stack Program - Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

5 - Map Algorithm - A program that looks for the word entered by the user in a predefined dictionary.

6 - Transform Algorithm - A program that transforms a list into it's squared counterparts using the transform function.

7 - Reverse Integer - A program the reverses the integer entered by the user.

The source code for all the above mentioned algorithms are available in C++ language in this repository.

This repository also contains the resume profile pages of all group members added in index.html 

The repository also contains the needed header file(S) for these algorithms.

The editor Visual Studio code was used for this project.
